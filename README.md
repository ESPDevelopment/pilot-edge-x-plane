# pilot-edge-x-plane
X-Plane custom scenery for the PilotEdge network

This repository provides custom scenery for airports in the PilotEdge (pilotedge.net) network. The focus of this project is to provide custom scenery for these airports where the default scenery is lacking in detail and/or accuracy. If, in our opinion, the default scenery in X-Plane 10 is of sufficient quality and detail, we won't spend time trying to add to it or improve it.  Further, this repository will focus on Class D and Class E airports initially.

You are welcome to use the scenery files as is or download them and make your own modifications.  To install a custom scenery package to your X-Plane installation:

  1. Download the desired scenery package directory (e.g. "KCMA Camarillo")
  2. Copy the directory and its contents to your X-Plane 10 custom scenery directory (e.g. "C:\X-Plane 10\Custom Scenery")
  3. Start or restart X-Plane 10

If you run into issues with any of the scenery files, please post an "Issue" to this repository.  We will attempt to address your concern as quickly as possible.

The orthoimagery has been downloaded from the U.S. Geological Survey web site (http://viewer.nationalmap.gov/viewer/).  It is not necessary to download these files unless you feel compelled to make adjustments to the orthophotos used in the custom scenery files.

Enjoy!
